Title: Empirical Transition Matrix
Version: 1.0
Author: Arthur Allignol
Description: The etm (empirical transition matrix) package permits to estimate the matrix of transition probabilities for any time-inhomogeneous multistate model with finite state space using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Functions for data preparation and for displaying are also included. Functionals of the Aalen-Johansen estimator, e.g., excess length-of-stay in an intermediate state, can also be computed.
